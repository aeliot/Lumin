This project is a control system for a LPD8806 LED strip.  The LED strip will be connected to an Arduino with an XBee interface, the control signal comes from a Raspberry Pi, also with an XBee interface, acting as a network gateway and as a controller that can make up more complex patterns then the Arduino.

To-do:
[ ] Actually get the LED's, I hate waiting for the mail.
[ ] Arduino LED control code.
[ ] Pi-Arduino communication system.
[ ] Raspberry Pi library for controlling the Arduino.
[ ] Interfaces for Pi: web, iOS, Android, anything else that tickles my fancy.
[ ] Capacitive touch wheel for Arduino to control master brightness.
